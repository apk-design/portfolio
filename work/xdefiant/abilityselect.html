      <h1>XDefiant: Ability Select Restriction</h1>
      <p class="muted">
        In ranked modes for XDefiant, players repeatedly told us that teams
        didn’t <em>feel</em> balanced, even when the underlying systems said they were.
        After an internal playtest and a dedicated pro gamer review, we introduced a new
        system: Ability Select Restriction – only one player on a team
        can bring a given ability into a match..
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal was to make this restriction feel fair, readable, and deliberate,
        while still giving stakeholders what they wanted most from this screen:
        big, expressive character art.

      <ul>
        <li>The lead UI artist, to translate the UX into a shippable, branded interface</li>
        <li>Gameplay designers, to align restrictions with balance and ranked rules</li>
        <li>A pro gamer consultant, who stress-tested the flow from a competitive lens</li>
        <li>UI Tech Artists, to confirm we could support the necessary real-time states</li>

        <li><strong>At-a-glance clarity</strong> on what their team is bringing into a match</li>
        <li><strong>Fast decision making</strong> under time pressure, on controller and M+K</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback</strong> when something is restricted, and why</li>
        <li><strong>Fairness</strong>: no one wants to feel “locked out” without understanding the rules</li>

    <!-- ORIGINAL DESIGN -------------------------------------------------------->
    <section id="original-design">
      <h2>What We Started With</h2>

      <p>
        Before this work, our character selection screen already combined
        Faction + Ability into a single step. It did its job, but it
        treated abilities almost like a checklist: technically available, but not surfaced
        as a strategic choice.
      </p>

        <h2>Stakeholder Ask: Increase Character Presence</h2>
        <p>
          Our initial ability-selection UI was built for clarity first — tight grids, fast scanning,
          low cognitive load. But during stakeholder reviews, leadership wanted more character visibility
          to better support long-term cosmetic and IP identity strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>UX Design: Reframing Faction + Ability as a System</h2>

        <p>
          From a UX perspective, I treated this screen as a
          team composition tool, not just a gallery. The core principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> Factions and characters at the top, abilities anchored below.</li>
          <li><strong>Spatial mapping:</strong> Abilities are visually tied to the chosen faction.</li>
          <li><strong>Readability at speed:</strong> Typography and groupings that hold up in the last 5 seconds of
            a
            countdown.</li>
        </ul>

          <figcaption>
            Mid-fidelity UX layout: factions grouped into readable rows, large character art

      <!-- UI DESIGN: FACTION + ABILITY ------------------------------------------>
      <section id="ui-faction-ability">
        <h2>UI Design: Shipping the New Faction Select</h2>

        <p>
          Once the UX was stable, the UI team pushed it into a branded, shippable treatment:
          bold faction typography, clear rarity and lock states, and full-bleed character art.
          My role here was to protect the UX intent: ensuring that visual flourishes never
          compromised contrast, focus states, or input affordances.
        </p>

      <!-- FEEDBACK TOWARD ABILITY SELECT RESTRICTION ---------------------------->
      <section id="playtest-feedback">
        <h2>Playtest Feedback: “Teams Don’t Feel Balanced”</h2>

        <p>
          After this version shipped internally, we ran an
          internal playtest and a pro gamer review. The consistent theme:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Teams technically <em>could</em> stack strong abilities, and when they did,
            the opposing team felt disadvantaged from the lobby onward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players had low visibility into what their teammates had already chosen.
            It was easy to double-pick the same powerful ability without realizing it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In response, design introduced Ability Select Restriction for ranked:
          every ability can only appear once per team. UX now needed to
          make that rule obvious, fair, and fast to interpret.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- UX FOR ABILITY SELECT RESTRICTION ------------------------------------->
      <section id="asr-ux">
        <h2>UX for Ability Select Restriction</h2>

        <p>
          I approached Ability Select Restriction as a visibility and feedback problem:
          players should understand, at a glance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who has locked what</strong></li>
          <li><strong>What’s still open</strong> to choose</li>
          <li><strong>Why something is blocked</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Team Composition as a Live Status Bar</h3>
        <p>
          First, I created a Team Composition system — a compact but expressive
          representation of each player’s state (no pick, character only, character+ability)
          using consistent iconography and labels.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="/work/xdefiant/assets/asr7-teamcomp.png"
            alt="Team Composition UX panel showing different player selection states">
          <figcaption>
            Team Composition UX: each card communicates where a player is in the selection
            process, so you can scan your team without leaving your own selection.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Faction Groups + Ability Buttons</h3>
        <p>
          To keep cognitive load low, I decomposed the restriction state into
          three simple conditions per faction:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Faction open: no abilities taken yet</li>
          <li>One ability taken: one slot open, one tagged with a teammate’s name</li>
          <li>Both taken: faction closed for new picks</li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
          <img src="/work/xdefiant/assets/asr8-group-ability.png"
            alt="UX flow showing faction groups and ability button states under restriction">
          <figcaption>
            Faction + ability states: open, partially claimed, and fully locked, with player tags
            on the abilities they chose.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Progression Through States</h3>
        <p>
          I then mapped how the screen should evolve as teammates lock in. The focus was on:
          <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> (only reveal relevant warnings) and
          <strong>predictable patterns</strong> (same visual language for locks everywhere).
        </p>

      <section id="asr-ui">

        <p>
          The final UI treatment integrates restriction states into the existing
          faction-select layout without introducing new visual systems. We reused:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lock iconography</strong> that players already knew from character unlocks</li>
          <li><strong>High-contrast tags</strong> to show which teammate owns an ability</li>
          <li><strong>Consistent positions</strong> for team status at the top of the screen</li>

        <h2>Things We Wanted to Add (But Couldn’t Ship)</h2>

        <p>
          Team Composition shipped, but the game was shut down around the release of Season 3,
          before we could finish several adjacent features. These stayed at UX or WIP UI:
        </p>

        <h3>Challenge Widget</h3>
        <p>
          A small widget that surfaced ability-related challenges on the same
          screen, so players didn’t need to context-switch to another menu to decide what to
          bring into a match.
        </p>

            UX exploration for a challenge widget tied directly to ability and faction choice.

        </figure>

        <h3>Skin Selection in the Same Flow</h3>
        <p>
          To support monetization goals without harming usability, I explored a
          lightweight skin selector attached to the character column. The idea
          was to keep the primary decision (faction + ability) in focus, while making skins a
          secondary, optional action.
        </p>

      <section id="impact-and-reflection">
        <h2>Impact &amp; What I’d Do Differently</h2>

        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Even without full rollout of the restriction UI, this work:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gave tech artists and our UI lead a clear framework for how restriction rules would surface in UI</li>
          <li>Created a shared language (icons, states, team comps) across UX, UI, and gameplay design</li>
          <li>Helped clarify future-facing decisions around skins, challenges, and ranked-only behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I’d Do Differently</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Push harder on controller efficiency.
            I proposed grouping abilities behind factions to reduce the number of “clicks”
            required to move across the row, especially on controller. In practice this would
            have turned a long lateral movement into a two-step interaction
            (select faction, then select from that faction’s ability subgroup), which is more
            in line with Fitts’s Law and supports faster target acquisition.
            Stakeholders ultimately preferred the flatter layout; in hindsight I’d bring
            stronger prototypes and data to that conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Move usability testing earlier for the restriction states, so we could validate
            language and iconography with non-competitive players as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explore a lightweight “fairness preview” — some way of indicating
            team archetypes (e.g., double support, heavy disruption) to help close the loop on
            the “does this feel balanced?” question.
