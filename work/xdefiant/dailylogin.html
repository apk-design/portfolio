                This project was created for a venture capital firm's portfolio companies with high-volume
                frontline roles. The goal was to build an on-site job application system designed for walk-in
                candidates. The platform streamlined the application process and embedded a mandatory
                safety-oriented quiz to help identify candidates with strong situational awareness and
                responsibility.

            <h2>Daily Login UX — Reward Calendar</h2>
            <p> I designed a new daily login experience for an online game in collaboration with the MTX (monetization)
                team and the lead UI artist. MTX provided a reference reward grid focused on player retention. My role
                was to translate that grid into an engaging, legible UX that: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearly communicates what players get today and in the future</li>
                <li>Encourages streaks and long-term return without feeling confusing or overwhelming</li>
                <li>Scales to different reward campaigns (weekly / monthly)</li>
                <li>Hands off cleanly to UI art for final visual polish</li>
            </ul>
            <figure> <img src="/mnt/data/xd daily login.png"
                    alt="Top-left reference reward grid provided by MTX team, showing rows of icons for daily rewards">
                <figcaption>MTX reference grid that defined reward cadence and retention goals.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </section>
        <section id="problem-and-constraints">
            <h2>Problem & Constraints</h2>
            <p> The existing daily login treatment did not clearly show progression or upcoming milestones. MTX wanted a
                system that could support both short “bursts” of rewards and longer campaigns, while reinforcing return
                habits through clear streaks and milestone rewards. </p>
            <p>The main UX challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represent many days of rewards without clutter</li>
                <li>Highlight “today” and the next big milestone</li>
                <li>Make it obvious which rewards are claimed vs. locked</li>
                <li>Keep the layout flexible for localization and art direction</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="exploration-weekly">
            <h2>Exploration 1 — Weekly Track Concept</h2>
            <p> The first prototype framed the daily login as a weekly track. Each day appeared as a tile in a short
                horizontal sequence, making it easy to grasp the full week at a glance. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short horizon:</strong> Only shows the current week to keep cognitive load low.</li>
                <li><strong>Strong focus on the present:</strong> “Today” is highlighted with a prominent tile and
                    reward callout.</li>
                <li><strong>Completion feedback:</strong> Past days are marked as claimed, giving a strong sense of
                    streak and progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> This direction tested well with stakeholders because it was immediately readable and clearly showcased
                today’s reward, but it didn’t give MTX as much room to tease longer-term rewards and big milestones.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="exploration-monthly">
            <h2>Exploration 2 — Monthly Calendar Concept</h2>
            <p> The second prototype explored a longer-range, calendar-like layout. Here, players could see a full
                campaign: many days of rewards, including premium milestones further out. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Long-term visibility:</strong> Shows most or all days in the event, so players can “plan”
                    their return.</li>
                <li><strong>Milestone emphasis:</strong> Special rewards (e.g., end-of-month or streak bonuses) are
                    called out with larger tiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Grid structure:</strong> Calendar-style grid helps players understand how far they’ve
                    progressed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> This version met MTX’s desire to support longer campaigns and generate anticipation, but it was denser
                and risked overwhelming new players. </p>

        <section id="hybrid-solution">
            <h2>Final UX — Hybrid of Weekly & Monthly</h2>
            <p> After walking MTX and the lead UI artist through both prototypes, stakeholders asked for a hybrid that
                combined: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The clarity and focus of the weekly track</li>
                <li>The anticipation and milestone planning of the monthly view</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The final UX solution mixed both ideas: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A focused row or segment for the upcoming days, with a clear highlight on today’s reward</li>
                <li>Progress indicators that show how far along the overall campaign the player is</li>
                <li>Visually distinct milestone tiles that stand out from regular daily rewards</li>
                <li>Clean iconography and labels so rewards are understandable at a glance</li>
            </ul>
            <figure> <img src="/mnt/data/xd daily login.png"

        </section>
        <section id="handoff-to-ui">
            <h2>Handoff & Final In-Game UI</h2>
            <p> Once the UX pattern was approved, I documented interaction details (states for claimed, current, locked,
                and milestone rewards, as well as animation suggestions for claiming and advancing) and handed the
                design to the lead UI artist. </p>
            <p> The UI artist then applied the game’s visual style, character artwork, and motion, while preserving the
                information hierarchy and flows from the UX prototype. </p>

        <section id="impact-and-learnings">
            <h2>Impact & Learnings</h2>
            <p> While MTX primarily owned quantitative results, the new daily login UX was designed to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make reward progression self-explanatory without tooltips</li>
                <li>Encourage players to return regularly through clear streak feedback and milestone rewards</li>
                <li>Give MTX enough flexibility to run both short and long campaigns without redesigning the UI</li>
            </ul>
            <p> From a process perspective, the biggest win was involving MTX and UI art early with two distinct
                prototypes, then converging on a hybrid that aligned retention goals with player readability and
                aesthetic quality. </p>
