        I redesigned the in-game Store to support clearer navigation, stronger merchandising,
        and a more efficient purchasing flow. The goal was to give players a clean, modern
        interface with intuitive browsing, while simultaneously preparing the UI for
        full localization and accessibility compliance across multiple languages.

      <h1>XDefiant — Store & Bundle Tile Localization Redesign</h1>

      <p class="muted">
        I redesigned the XDefiant store, bundle structure, and product tiles after we started
        seeing localization issues in Arabic and Ukrainian. The original layout had been built
        quickly to support launch, and it struggled once strings became longer and bundles
        more complex. This work focused on making the store more legible, localization-safe,
        and scalable without adding heavy new logic to an already development-dense graph.

      <h2>What I Started From</h2>

      <div class="inline-pair">

            <img src="/work/xdefiant/assets/store-oldtile.png"
              alt="Original XDefiant bundle tile showing only a 'BUNDLE' label and price">
            <figcaption>
              Original bundle tile — visually strong hero art, but almost no information density,
              and no plan for longer localized strings.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="inline-pair__content">
          <p>
            The existing bundle tile only exposed a “BUNDLE” label and a price. Everything else
            (what the pack contained, how many currencies it used, what was premium vs. bonus)
            lived in supporting UI. That worked acceptably in English, but completely broke down
            once Arabic and Ukrainian strings were added – the layout simply had nowhere for
            longer words to go.
          </p>
        </div>

    <section id="store-team-role">
      <h2>The Team &amp; My Role</h2>

      <p>
        I worked as the UX designer on this effort, partnering closely with:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The MTX (monetization) team, who owned business goals and pricing strategy.</li>
        <li>One UI Tech Artist, who helped me understand what the existing store graph
          could realistically support.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I owned the end-to-end UX for the store refresh: auditing the current layout,
        mapping localization failures, redesigning the bundle structure and tile, and
        documenting final specs and states for implementation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- PLAYERS & NEEDS -------------------------------------------------------->
    <section id="store-players-needs">
      <h2>Players &amp; Their Needs</h2>

      <p>
        Store work looks like “just art” from the outside, but the players here were
        pretty clear:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> What exactly am I buying? Is this a bundle, a skin, a currency pack?</li>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Does the tile reflect the same offer in every language and platform?</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Can I scan tiles quickly with a controller and still understand value?</li>
        <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Does the layout feel consistent regardless of language length?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- PROBLEM: LOCALIZATION & STRUCTURE -------------------------------------->
    <section id="store-problem">
      <h2>The Problem Behind the Pretty Tile</h2>

      <p>
        Once Arabic and Ukrainian were added, the store started to show its seams:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Longer strings pushed outside the tile frame or collapsed into illegible wrapping.</li>
        <li>Key information (what the bundle contained, which currencies were used) had to be
          dropped or abbreviated per language.</li>
        <li>The store graph was already development-heavy, so we couldn’t “just add more UI”
          without increasing complexity and risk.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Asset: /work/xdefiant/assets/store-localization.png -->

          the original tile layout was.

    <!-- APPROACH: REFRAMING THE TILE AS A SYSTEM ------------------------------->
    <section id="store-approach">
      <h2>Approach: Treating the Tile as a System, Not a Poster</h2>

      <p>
        Instead of treating each bundle as a mini poster, I reframed the tile as a compact
        system for communicating value. That meant designing backwards from constraints:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Localization first:</strong> Typesetting and grid decisions were driven by
          the <em>longest</em> expected strings, not just English.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusable structure:</strong> The same tile template needed to work for
          single items, bundles, and future promo types.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal graph impact:</strong> Any changes had to sit on top of the
          existing store graph, not restructure it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Redesigning the Bundle Structure &amp; Product Tile</h2>

      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Top band:</strong> Promotional flags like “Limited Time” or “Sale”, designed
          to hold localized labels without overlapping art.</li>
        <li><strong>Middle:</strong> Hero art focused on the key characters or weapons.</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom white panel:</strong> Name, contents, and price, laid out on a flexible

    <section id="store-states">
      <h2>States: Inactive vs. Active Selection</h2>

      <p>
        Because the store needed to be fully navigable on controller, I treated the inactive
        and active states as part of the information hierarchy, not just a hover effect.
        The goal was that players could feel a clear “step up” in focus without losing
        legibility.

      <h2>Iteration with MTX &amp; Tech Art</h2>

      <p>
        I iterated on the tile and bundle structure with the MTX team and our UI Tech Artist:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>MTX pushed for clearer value communication: it needed to be obvious when a bundle
          contained multiple items vs. a single premium skin.</li>
        <li>The Tech Artist surfaced where the graph was most fragile, so I could avoid
          solutions that needed new nodes or bespoke logic.</li>
        <li>Localization reviews highlighted where Arabic and Ukrainian still needed more
          breathing room, so I widened the bottom text panel and re-balanced type sizes.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- CONSTRAINTS ------------------------------------------------------------>
    <section id="store-constraints">
      <h2>Constraints I Worked Around</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Heavily loaded store graph:</strong> The store was already one of the more
          complex graphs in the game. I had to treat every new UI element as a cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited time to iterate:</strong> This work happened alongside other
          live-service priorities, so I leaned on lightweight prototypes and static mocks
          instead of full interactive flows.</li>
        <li><strong>No major IA changes:</strong> The navigation model for the store stayed
          the same; all improvements had to come from tile structure and presentation.</li>

    <!-- IMPACT ----------------------------------------------------------------->
    <section id="store-impact">
      <h2>What This Work Set Up</h2>

      <p>
        The redesigned store and tile system shipped internally before XDefiant was sunset
        in Summer 2025. Because the team was let go shortly after the release of Season 3,
        we weren’t able to run the long-term experiments we had planned or collect detailed
        metrics.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, the work left the team with:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>localization-ready tile template</strong> that held up under Arabic
          and Ukrainian without bespoke exceptions.</li>
        <li>A <strong>clear UX spec</strong> for bundle structure and tile states that could
          be reused across future promos and offers.</li>
        <li>A shared understanding across MTX and Tech Art of how to evolve the store without
          overloading the underlying graph.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- REFLECTION ------------------------------------------------------------->
    <section id="store-reflection">
      <h2>What I Would Have Done Next</h2>

      <p>
        If the project had continued past Season 3, I would have:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Run more player testing around value perception.</strong>
          We started from localization pain, but I would have loved to run A/B tests
          on different ways of surfacing “what’s in the bundle” and how that influenced
          purchase confidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pushed the system into more edge cases.</strong>
          Things like free rewards, cross-promotion tiles, or bonus currency grants
          would have been great stress tests for the template.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Explored a more modular store layout.</strong>
          The next step would have been to apply the same system thinking to
          carousels and event panels, so the whole store felt as considered as the tile.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Even though XDefiant was sunset, this project reinforced a pattern I keep coming back to:
        treat every “single screen” as a system. When the underlying logic is clear and
        localization is part of the design from day one, the UI stays stable even as the
        game and business evolve around it.
