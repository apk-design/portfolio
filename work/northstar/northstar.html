                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>
                        Looking for help with mental health or substance use is rarely neutral. It usually comes with
                        fear,
                        hesitation, and a lot of social baggage. As I reviewed existing treatment websites, I noticed a
                        pattern of
                        bright visuals, urgency-heavy copy, and constant pressure to “act now.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That approach might work for conversions, but it can also make an already stressful moment feel
                        louder and
                        more overwhelming. I wanted to see what it would look like to do the opposite.
                    </p>

                <section id="branding">
                    <h2>Branding, Visual Direction, and the Birth of <i>North Star Wellness Resources</i></h2>
                    <p>While brainstorming for this project, I was between a few different names. Phoenix,
                        <i>Kintsugi</i>, Anchor, Lighthouse - with the implication being changing your life or
                        providing stability if you're knee deep in chaos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ended up settling on 'North Star', as the concept and function of the titular term is
                        built around orientation, not transformation. The brand doesn’t promise clarity or change.
                        It’s meant to feel like a steady reference point for people who aren’t sure what their
                        next step is yet. I chose Wellness Resources as it had the propensity to cover a lot of
                        different problem areas.

                    <p>
                        That idea shaped everything from the name and logo to the overall visual language. I kept
                        the branding calm, aiming for something that felt approachable without being performative.

                    <p>
                        The site uses a predominantly dark interface on purpose. For a lot of people, especially those
                        dealing with
                        stigma or fear around needing help, visibility itself can feel uncomfortable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The darker UI:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Feels more private and contained</li>
                        <li>Works better for late-night or discreet browsing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This was as much of an aesthetic choice as much as an emotional one. The goal was to lower
                        friction and make it
                        easier for someone to stay on the site long enough to actually absorb the information. I did
                        want to ensure that for those who were browsing in front of others, that it remained an intimate
                        and optimistic experience.

                        Within the 24-hour constraint, this concept focuses on emotional safety, clear hierarchy, and
                        user autonomy.
                        Though this is not a real site, even in an imaginary context, I would rather help a vulnerable

                        feel oriented enough to decide what they want to do next, when they’re ready. That being said, I
                        ran into some issues while on this project, that I will go into in the next section.

                    <h3>Figma Makes Me Eat My Words</h3>
                    <p>My first mistake was to rest far too much on Figma as my main graphics program. While I do
                        think I am pretty talented in Figma, there are two major things I would typically <i>not</i>
                        use it for - those being graphic / logo creation, and typesetting.</p>
                    <p>Arguably, the most important thing I was not aware of whatsoever is that Figma will start to slow
                        down if you use more than 2GB on a free plan. For some context, I have created branding and UX +
                        UI flows for a start up, very literally ~1000 screens of work for local companies, not to
                        mention all the various kanban boards, personal sprints, art ideas, and so much more content on
                        my free figma plan. </p>
                    <p>Foolishly, even as the program got slower, I carried on, knowing that a crash was coming, just
                        not knowing when. And then it did, 4 consecutive times. And then again, to the point where I was
                        having to cmd + opt + esc Figma every 15 minutes or so. Pasting a group took a whopping 30
                        seconds. In my own hubris to use the program to the fullest, I ended up impairing its usefulness
                        entirely. </p>

                        <h3>The Time Limit Somehow Gets Further Limited</h3>
                        <p>When the wonderful HR person spoke to me regarding the time limit, she emphasized that I
                            should make sure that I have enough time to work on this. While on the phone, I assured her
                            that I totally had enough time, and I thought I was correct until my calender decided to
                            finally make time for high prio stuff.</p>
                        <p>"Look, the Doctor finally got back to you, and wow, she has a slot for tomorrow now - the
                            next time you can see her is in April! Look, Mom called you in the middle of the day to
                            discuss something important! Look, the one interview you had scheduled for next week
                            actually won't happen unless you take the 2 hour call today!"</p>
                        <p>My 24 hour time limit became 22, 20, 18, and then 16, not counting the 8 I generally
                            (optimistically) should have for sleep.</p>
                        <p>My previously clear Friday became dense with activity, and of course, with Figma moving at a
                            snail's pace, my window was shrinking.</p>
                        <p>Just to emphasize, I am not asking for sympathy here, more so acknowledging the mistake that
                            I made. In an effort to be seen as reliable by everyone, I had inadvertently spread myself
                            far too thin. And sadly, I didn't feel like I was there for any of it.</p>
                        <p>I forgot to ask my Doctor questions, I didn't reassure my mom's fears, I was nervous during
                            my interview, and while ultimately, I am happy about what I made with a few hours, it does
                            not contain everything I would have done had I had enough time. </p>

                        <h3>Miscommunication Breakdown</h3>
                        <p>I think the worst thing that I did is not being forthright about not having enough time. It
                            was probably the main thing I had felt that I had control over, but, I didn't wish to make
                            excuses on the day of as to why it wasn't in, so I tried to roll with the punches.</p>
                        <img src="/work/northstar/assets/githubfailsme.png" alt="github error message "
                            style="width:100%">
                        <figcaption>Seemingly, Github takes the opportunity to kick me while I am down.</figcaption>
                        <p>While struggling to send everything over neatly, Gmail began giving me its typical, 'ah,
                            these files are too big, better luck next time 'error message, around 10 minutes before the
                            due date. I began to panic, and made a Google Drive folder and tossed everything I thought I
                            had ready into it, and emailed it over at 4:59 - phew. I caught my breath for a few minutes,
                            and checked back to see that I received a reply - yay!
                        </p>
                        <p>Oh wait, no yay. Oh my gosh, I locked it and sent it over? Okay, I will unlock it, but let me
                            see if everything pushed to the website. Seems like everything but the videos? Okay cool,
                            let me confirm with the HR lead that she saw the website. Yay, she sent me an email saying
                            she saw what was in the screenshot I sent her. Oh wait, she actually did not say that at
                            all, she said that she just saw the screenshot itself that I had attached. Oh. My. God. </p>
                        <div class="video-wrapper">
                            <iframe
                                src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1163234642?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"
                                frameborder="0"

                        </div>

                        <p>The worst part was that I had all the files. Everything that was mandatory were
                            things I had already had, I just couldn't get it to export correctly and have Figma
                            stay open for long enough.</p>

                        <h3>I began to crave a second chance.</h3>
                        <p>The very kind HR professional had emphasized that she wanted to ensure that I would have
                            enough time to make:
                        <ul>- Logo and Branding</ul>
                        <ul>- Desktop Mockup</ul>
                        <ul>- Rationale</ul>
                        While on paper, I did deliver, I really did believe I could do better, especially since I really
                        want to work here.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so, feeling like I had it in me, and that I like to make sure I am able to put out work
                            that I feel proud of, I gave myself 4 hours to improve what I could offer. </p>

                    <p>I am most definitely not immune to criticism, and I would like to believe that I am good at both giving and taking it. So I began my 4 hours by doing a quick once-over on what I had already.</p>
