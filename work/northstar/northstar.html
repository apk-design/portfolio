                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>
                        Looking for help with mental health or substance use is rarely neutral. It usually comes with
                        fear,
                        hesitation, and a lot of social baggage. As I reviewed existing treatment websites, I noticed a
                        pattern of
                        bright visuals, urgency-heavy copy, and constant pressure to “act now.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That approach might work for conversions, but it can also make an already stressful moment feel
                        louder and
                        more overwhelming. I wanted to see what it would look like to do the opposite.
                    </p>

                <section id="branding">
                    <h2>Branding, Visual Direction, and the Birth of <i>North Star Wellness Resources</i></h2>
                    <p>While brainstorming for this project, I was between a few different names. Phoenix,
                        <i>Kintsugi</i>, Anchor, Lighthouse - with the implication being changing your life or
                        providing stability if you're knee deep in chaos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ended up settling on 'North Star', as the concept and function of the titular term is
                        built around orientation, not transformation. The brand doesn’t promise clarity or change.
                        It’s meant to feel like a steady reference point for people who aren’t sure what their
                        next step is yet. I chose Wellness Resources as it had the propensity to cover a lot of
                        different problem areas.

                    <p>
                        That idea shaped everything from the name and logo to the overall visual language. I kept
                        the branding calm, aiming for something that felt approachable without being performative.

                    <p>
                        The site uses a predominantly dark interface on purpose. For a lot of people, especially those
                        dealing with
                        stigma or fear around needing help, visibility itself can feel uncomfortable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The darker UI:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Feels more private and contained</li>
                        <li>Works better for late-night or discreet browsing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This was as much of an aesthetic choice as much as an emotional one. The goal was to lower
                        friction and make it
                        easier for someone to stay on the site long enough to actually absorb the information. I did
                        want to ensure that for those who were browsing in front of others, that it remained an intimate
                        and optimistic experience.

                        Within the 24-hour constraint, this concept focuses on emotional safety, clear hierarchy, and
                        user autonomy.
                        Though this is not a real site, even in an imaginary context, I would rather help a vulnerable
                        individual
                        feel oriented enough to decide what they want to do next, when they’re ready. That being said, I
                        ran into some issues while on this project, that I will go into in the next section.

                        use it for - those being graphic / logo creation, and typesetting.</p>
                    <p>Arguably, the most important thing I was not aware of whatsoever is that Figma will start to slow
                        down if you use more than 2GB on a free plan. For some context, I have created branding and UX +
                        UI flows for a start up, very literally ~1000 screens of work for local companies, not to
                        mention all the various kanban boards, personal sprints, art ideas, and so much more content on
                        my free figma plan. Needless to say, we were well passed the threshold.</p>
                    <p>Foolishly, even as the program got slower, I carried on, knowing that a crash was coming, just
                        not knowing when. And then it did, 4 consecutive times. And then again, to the point where I was
                        having to cmd + opt + esc Figma every 15 minutes or so. Pasting a group took a whopping 30
                        seconds. In my own hubris to use the program to the fullest, I ended up impairing its usefulness
                        entirely. </p>

                        <h3>The Time Limit Somehow Gets Further Limited</h3>
                        <p>When the wonderful HR person spoke to me regarding the time limit, she emphasized that I
                            should make sure that I have enough time to work on this. While on the phone, I assured her
                            that I totally had enough time, and I thought I was correct until my calender decided to
                            finally make time for high prio stuff.</p>
                        <p>"Look, the Doctor finally got back to you, and wow, she has a slot for tomorrow now - the
                            next time you can see her is in April! Look, Mom called you in the middle of the day to
                            discuss something important! Look, the one interview you had scheduled for next week
                            actually won't happen unless you take the 2 hour call today!"</p>
                        <p>My 24 hour time limit became 22, 20, 18, and then 16, not counting the 8 I generally
                            (optimistically) should have for sleep.</p>
                        <p>My previously clear Friday became dense with activity, and of course, with Figma moving at a
                            snail's pace, my window was shrinking.</p>
                        <p>Just to emphasize, I am not asking for sympathy here, more so acknowledging the mistake that
                            I made. In an effort to be seen as reliable by everyone, I had inadvertently spread myself
                            far too thin. And sadly, I didn't feel like I was there for any of it.</p>
                        <p>I forgot to ask my Doctor questions, I didn't reassure my mom's fears, I was nervous during
                            my interview, and while ultimately, I am happy about what I made with a few hours, it does
                            not contain everything I would have done had I had enough time. </p>

                        <h3>Miscommunication Breakdown</h3>
                        <p>I think the worst thing that I did is not being forthright about not having enough time. It
                            was probably the main thing I had felt that I had control over, but, I didn't wish to make
                            excuses on the day of as to why it wasn't in, so I tried to roll with the punches.</p>
                        <img src="/work/northstar/assets/githubfailsme.png" alt="github error message "
                            style="width:100%">
                        <figcaption>Seemingly, Github takes the opportunity to kick me while I am down.</figcaption>
                        <p>While struggling to send everything over neatly, Gmail began giving me its typical, 'ah,
                            these files are too big, better luck next time 'error message, around 10 minutes before the
                            due date. I began to panic, and made a Google Drive folder and tossed everything I thought I
                            had ready into it, and emailed it over at 4:59 - phew. I caught my breath for a few minutes,
                            and checked back to see that I received a reply - yay!
                        </p>
                        <p>Oh wait, no yay. Oh my gosh, I locked it and sent it over? Okay, I will unlock it, but let me
                            see if everything pushed to the website. Seems like everything but the videos? Okay cool,
                            let me confirm with the HR lead that she saw the website. Yay, she sent me an email saying
                            she saw what was in the screenshot I sent her. Oh wait, she actually did not say that at
                            all, she said that she just saw the screenshot itself that I had attached. Oh. My. God. </p>
                        <div class="video-wrapper">
                            <iframe
                                src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1163234642?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"

                        </div>

                        <p>The worst part was that I had all the files. Everything that was mandatory were
                            things I had already had, I just couldn't get it to export correctly and have Figma
                            stay open for long enough.</p>

                        <h3>I began to crave a second chance.</h3>
                        <p>The very kind HR professional had emphasized that she wanted to ensure that I would have
                            enough time to make:
                            <li> Logo and Branding</li>
                            <li> Desktop Mockup</ul>
                            <li> Rationale</li>
                            While on paper, I did deliver, I really did believe I could do better, especially since I
                            really
                            want to work here.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so, feeling like I had it in me, and that I like to make sure I am able to put out work
                            that I feel proud of, I gave myself 1 hour to improve what I could offer. </p>
                </section>

                <section id="redemption">
                    <h2>Redeeming Myself</h2>
                    <p>I am most definitely not immune to criticism, and I would like to believe that I am good at both
                        giving and taking it. So I began my hour by doing a quick once-over on what I had already.</p>
                    <p>Since this was a conceptual assignment, I didn’t wish to keep iterating to the point where it
                        stopped feeling honest or representative of how I’d actually work under constraints.</p>
                    <img src="/work/northstar/assets/selfaudit.png" alt="self auditing " style="width:100%">
                    <figcaption>Beginning my work the best way I know how - qualitative analysis! </figcaption>
                    <p>Based on my earlier site assessment, I made a series of targeted updates to the homepage to
                        strengthen clarity and trust without changing the overall tone. I added early trust signals
                        around accreditation, evidence-based care, and insurance to ground users immediately, clarified
                        CTA intent with more explicit language, and surfaced program-level cues to reduce ambiguity
                        around care options. Clinical credibility is now named directly rather than implied, and small
                        framing changes around testimonials and reassurance copy help lower pressure for users who may
                        still be unsure. These updates focus on making expectations clearer while preserving the
                        quieter, more contained experience I originally designed for.</p>
                    <img src="/work/northstar/assets/homepagewithmobile.png" alt="self auditing " style="width:100%">
                    <p>I usually try to design mobile first, but since we had a foundation and a little extra time, I
                        wanted to see if I could knock this out. </p>
                    <img src="/work/northstar/assets/ColorblindView.png" alt="self auditing " style="width:100%">
                    <p>Obligatory colorblind view for every known type! I feel like it's always thoughtful to include
                        this. I know this is a little small, but you are able to zoom in! </p>
                    <h3>The Actual Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>At the end of the day, this project was less about arriving at a “perfect” solution and more
                        about making thoughtful decisions under non-ideal conditions. Between a tight timeline and a lot
                        of very real interruptions, I had to choose what to focus on and what to
                        leave "unfinished". What mattered most to me was designing something that felt responsible,
                        empathetic, and grounded, especially given the context of mental health and substance-use care.
                        If nothing else, this exercise reinforced how much impact small, intentional choices can have
                        when people are already feeling unsure or overwhelmed. Even in a conceptual setting, I’d rather
                        build something that helps someone feel oriented enough to pause, reflect, and decide their next
                        step, than something that just looks complete.</p>

                    <p>What I actually completed:
                        <b><li>Named and branded a fictional healthcare company, North Star Wellness Resources</li>
                        <li>Designed a complete desktop homepage with navigation and structural implication of a sprawling site</li>
                        <li>Provided written rationale explaining design decisions, tradeoffs, and priorities (Thank you for reading this!!)</li></b>
                        <li>Developed a clear brand concept centered on orientation rather than transformation</li>
                        <li>Designed a scalable logo system that works in monochrome and dark UI contexts</li>
                        <li>Conducted qualitative competitive analysis of the reference sites</li>
                        <li>Applied research insights to UX improvements around clarity, trust signals, and CTA intent
                        </li>
                        <li>Worked within a strict 24-hour constraint and documented prioritization and the extension honestly</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>Overall, even though this was stressful at times under the time constraints, I found myself wanting more. The thing I missed most during this exercise was the ability to have other people look at the work and react to it. I intentionally limited feedback to myself in the spirit of fairness, but I would have really loved to hear how others responded and what they thought could be improved. Design is something I care about deeply, and while this challenge pushed me in uncomfortable ways, I can’t really imagine not wanting to keep working on it. I genuinely enjoyed a lot of this process, especially the branding work, and I would love the opportunity to continue building toward a stronger, more thoughtful product with your team.</p>
