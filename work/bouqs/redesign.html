        This project was created for a venture capital firm's portfolio companies with high-volume 
    frontline roles. The goal was to build an on-site job application system designed for walk-in 
    candidates. The platform streamlined the application process and embedded a mandatory 
    safety-oriented quiz to help identify candidates with strong situational awareness and 
    responsibility.

      I redesigned The Bouqs’ shopping experience to modernize the brand,
      simplify browsing, and improve accessibility while keeping the focus on
      lush floral photography.

<section id="bouqs-context">
  <h2>Context & Role</h2>
  <p>
    While working with The Bouqs, I was asked to explore a full-site refresh.
    The existing experience felt busy and dated, with limited hierarchy and
    inconsistent use of imagery. My role covered UX, visual design, and
    interaction design from early exploration through high-fidelity comps.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="bouqs-problem-goals">
  <h2>Problem & Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Customers loved the product photography but often struggled to scan
    collections, compare options, and understand what they were buying for
    important occasions (weddings, events, gifts). The site also needed better
    accessibility and a more modern brand expression.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clarify page hierarchy so shoppers can quickly find the right bouquet or collection.</li>
    <li>Make product cards and detail pages easier to scan and compare.</li>
    <li>Elevate the brand with a calmer, wedding-friendly visual language.</li>
    <li>Improve accessibility via contrast, type scale, and more structured layouts.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="bouqs-exploration">
  <h2>Exploration – Concept V1</h2>

  <!-- EXPLORATION IMAGE: use the V1 collage -->
  <!-- File: /mnt/data/v1- bouqs site redesign.png -->
  <figure>
    <img src="/mnt/data/v1- bouqs site redesign.png"
         alt="Collage of first-round Bouqs redesign screens showing updated homepage, category and product detail pages with soft green accents." />
    <figcaption>V1 exploration – establishing a softer palette and updated layouts.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The first concept focused on refreshing the existing structure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduced a soft sage and cream palette to better match the brand’s organic, floral feel.</li>
    <li>Cleaned up the navigation bar and hero area to highlight key collections.</li>
    <li>Updated product cards with more breathing room and tighter typography.</li>
    <li>Standardized photo ratios and card layouts for a more consistent grid.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    V1 already made the site calmer and more cohesive, but it still felt close
    to the original layout and didn’t fully leverage storytelling or clear
    shopping paths for different use cases (weddings, occasions, build-your-own
    bundles).
  </p>
</section>

<section id="bouqs-final-design">
  <h2>Final Direction – Concept V2</h2>

  <!-- FINAL DESIGN IMAGE: reuse the V2 collage as the main design plate -->
  <!-- File: /mnt/data/v2 bouqs site redesign.png -->
  <figure>
    <img src="/mnt/data/v2 bouqs site redesign.png"
         alt="Collage of final Bouqs redesign screens featuring editorial hero photography, collection modules, filterable grids, and simplified product pages." />
    <figcaption>V2 final direction – stronger storytelling and clearer shopping flows.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The second concept pushed further, reorganizing the experience around
    collections and occasions and leaning into storytelling with large
    editorial photography.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Homepage as story, not catalog.</strong>
      Larger hero photography with clear headline and CTA, followed by curated
      collections (“Wedding Bundles”, “Build Your Own Floral Package”) instead
      of a long undifferentiated product grid.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Collection-first layout.</strong>
      Dedicated collection pages group bouquets by style and palette, each with
      simple filters on the left and a clean product grid on the right.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Refined product detail pages.</strong>
      Bigger hero image, simplified information hierarchy (name, price, size,
      delivery details), and clear “Add to Cart” actions above the fold.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Editorial content modules.</strong>
      “How it works” and inspiration blocks use lifestyle photography to help
      shoppers imagine how arrangements will look in real events.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="bouqs-key-changes">
  <h2>Key UX & Visual Changes from V1 to V2</h2>
  <p>
    Between the first and second concept, I systematically refined the
    experience to be more accessible, modern, and task-focused:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Stronger visual hierarchy.</strong>
      Headings, subheadings, and body text now have clearer size and weight
      differences. Cards are grouped into distinct rows/sections, which makes
      scan paths more predictable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>More deliberate use of color.</strong>
      The V2 palette leans on a deeper green for CTAs and section headers,
      improving contrast and drawing attention to primary actions, while still
      feeling soft and botanical.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Improved card design.</strong>
      Product tiles show consistent photo sizes, concise names, pricing, and
      key badges (e.g., best seller). Spacing was increased to reduce visual
      noise and help on smaller screens.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility upgrades.</strong>
      Raised color contrast in buttons and text, increased base font sizes,
      and simplified background overlays behind text on photography to meet
      readability guidelines.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Clearer primary CTAs.</strong>
      Prominent “Shop the Collection” and “Build Your Own Bouquet” buttons
      appear in hero modules and collection intros, giving shoppers obvious
      next steps.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Content structure for different journeys.</strong>
      The redesign separates inspiration (editorial imagery, real weddings) from
      shopping tasks (filters, grid, PDP), so browsing feels enjoyable but
      decision-making remains simple.
    </li>
  </ul>
