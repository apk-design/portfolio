        This project was created for a venture capital firm's portfolio companies with high-volume 
    frontline roles. The goal was to build an on-site job application system designed for walk-in

    safety-oriented quiz to help identify candidates with strong situational awareness and

  <h2>The Bouqs – Wedding Style Quiz</h2>
  <p>
    While redesigning The Bouqs’ wedding experience, I proposed an optional style quiz
    that would guide couples to arrangements that matched their aesthetic, guest count,
    and budget. The quiz lives at the top of the wedding funnel and ends in a tailored
    product grid of curated collections.

</section>

<section id="bouqs-quiz-context">
  <h3>Context &amp; Role</h3>
  <p>
    The core redesign focused on simplifying wedding shopping and making it more
    accessible. I saw an opportunity to replace generic category browsing with a
    conversation: ask couples about their wedding and use those answers to recommend
    bouquets and collections that already “feel right”.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Product designer (research, UX, visual design).</li>
    <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Responsive web, integrated into the wedding experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Constraint:</strong> Quiz had to feel light and inspirational, not like a long survey.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="bouqs-quiz-problem">
  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Wedding customers often arrived with a vague idea like “romantic but not too
    traditional” and struggled to translate that into filters and SKUs. The existing
    experience asked for technical inputs (price, size, stems) before emotional ones
    (vibe, colors, venue), which made decision-making harder and increased drop-off.
  </p>

<section id="bouqs-quiz-solution-overview">
  <h3>Solution Overview</h3>
  <p>
    I designed a 10-step, image-driven quiz that feels like building a Pinterest moodboard.
    Each step captures a specific decision factor that feeds into a recommendation engine,
    which surfaces three curated collections tuned to the couple’s style, logistics, and budget.
  </p>

</section>

<section id="bouqs-quiz-decision-factors">
  <h3>What the Quiz Measures</h3>
  <p>
    Each step is intentionally visual and quick, but maps to a concrete set of attributes
    for the recommendation logic:
  </p>

  <article>
    <h4>1. Wedding Style</h4>
    <p>
      First, couples choose their overall wedding style from options like
      <em>Modern, Classic, Boho, Romantic, Vintage</em>. Multiple selection is allowed so
      the quiz can support blended aesthetics.
    </p>

    <!-- Imagery: first question only -->

           alt="Question asking What's your wedding style with bouquet options labeled Modern, Classic, Boho, Romantic, Vintage">
      <figcaption>Large bouquet photography as shorthand for each style.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>2. Overall Wedding Vibe</h4>
    <p>
      The next step asks, “Do you dream of your wedding being…” with lifestyle imagery
      for options like a <em>sophisticated, polished</em> celebration vs. a more
      <em>relaxed, airy</em> gathering. This controls how formal or casual the recommended
      designs should be.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Vibe question that tunes formality and texture.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>3. Color Palette</h4>
    <p>
      Couples select all color stories that feel right for their big day—soft neutrals,
      pastels, bold jewel tones, greenery-forward, etc. This directly maps to palette tags
      on bouquets and centerpieces.
    </p>

    <!-- Imagery: color options row -->

      <figcaption>Color options expressed as styled bouquets instead of swatches.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>4. Favorite Flowers</h4>
    <p>
      A multi-select gallery lets users highlight flowers they love (e.g., roses,
      hydrangeas, ranunculus). These are treated as boosts in the recommendation logic,
      raising matching designs to the top.
    </p>

    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>5. Inspiration &amp; Decor</h4>
    <p>
      The quiz then shows a grid of wedding-day photos and asks users to
      “Select the images that resonate with you the most.” This captures softer
      attributes like lighting, texture, and composition that don’t fit neatly into
      a drop-down.

    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>6. Venue &amp; Season</h4>
    <p>
      Users choose venue imagery that reflects the setting (indoor ballroom, open field,
      rustic barn, coastal, wintery, etc.). This informs flower durability,
      formality, and seasonally appropriate colors.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Venue and season affect flower types and palette recommendations.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>7. Budget Tier</h4>
    <p>
      A subtle step anchored in imagery asks couples to pick arrangements that feel
      closest to what they’d spend. This avoids upfront dollar amounts but still
      maps to pricing tiers behind the scenes.
    </p>

    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>8. Arrangements Needed for the Couple</h4>
    <p>
      The “Arrangements” step asks what the couple actually needs:
      just a bouquet, bouquet + boutonnière, or additional personal florals.
      This determines the structure of the final bundles.
    </p>

    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>9. Bridal Party Size</h4>
    <p>
      A visual count question (“How many people are in your bridal party?”) uses group
      photos labeled with ranges (3–5, 6–8, 9–12, etc.). This scales bundles up or down
      automatically.

    </figure>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>10. Guest Count</h4>
    <p>
      The final step asks, “How many guests do you expect at your reception?” again
      using labeled group photos. This drives quantities for centerpieces and other
      reception florals.
    </p>

  </article>
</section>

<section id="bouqs-quiz-results">
  <h3>Personalized Results</h3>
  <p>
    After the quiz, couples land on a tailored results page with three curated
    collections. Each collection is pre-filtered by style, palette, and budget,
    and includes the right mix of bouquets, boutonnieres, and centerpieces for the
    specified bridal party and guest count.

  </figure>
</section>

<section id="bouqs-quiz-ux-accessibility">
  <h3>UX &amp; Accessibility Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each step has a clear progress indicator on the left so users always know where they are and can move backward.</li>
    <li>Instructions like “Select all that apply” vs. “Select one” are explicit and repeated near the CTA.</li>
    <li>Large tap targets and high-contrast labels make options readable on both desktop and mobile.</li>
    <li>All imagery is paired with descriptive alt text for screen readers (e.g., “Outdoor fall wedding with warm copper tones”).</li>
    <li>The quiz can be exited at any time; partial answers still improve default recommendations.</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>
</section>

<section id="bouqs-quiz-outcomes">
  <h3>Outcomes &amp; Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    The quiz reframes wedding shopping as a guided, emotionally resonant experience:
    couples express who they are, and The Bouqs translates that into concrete product
    recommendations. Even without implementation data, the design explores how
    lightweight, image-led questions can dramatically reduce choice overload and
    make large wedding catalogs feel curated and personal.
