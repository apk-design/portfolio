                While working at a venture capital firm, I was asked to explore an internal solution that could replace

                external POS vendor.

        <section id="jobsource-overview">
            <h2>JobSource – Multi-sided hiring platform</h2>
            <p> JobSource was a concept-stage hiring platform I designed while working at a VC firm. The goal was to
                create something investors could immediately understand as a scalable product: a system where job
                seekers could maintain rich, structured profiles; employers could quickly evaluate candidates; and the
                platform could extend into new channels like mobile and digital wallets for real-world check-ins and
                events. </p>
            <p> My role covered product strategy, UX flows, and high-fidelity UI for candidate, employer, and admin
                experiences, as well as explorations in Apple Wallet and Apple Watch. </p>
            <!-- IMAGE: /mnt/data/jobsource - desktop hifi proto.png alt="JobSource desktop high-fidelity prototype showing a candidate profile with timeline-style activity and skills tags" -->
        </section>
        <section id="jobsource-candidate-desktop">
            <h2>Candidate Experience – Desktop Profile</h2>
            <p> For candidates, JobSource centered on a profile that felt more like a living portfolio than a static
                résumé. The layout gives a quick snapshot—name, title, location, and a compact overview card—followed by
                stacked sections for work experience, education, skills, and achievements. Each block is modular and
                scannable so recruiters can scroll and get a complete picture without losing context. </p>
            <p> I used consistent card structures and subtle dividers to keep long-form content readable, while the
                right column surfaces tags and filters that connect directly to matching jobs and search facets. </p>
            <!-- IMAGE: /mnt/data/jobsource - hi fil profile.png alt="Tall desktop storyboard of the JobSource candidate profile with vertically stacked cards for summary, experience, skills, and education" -->
        </section>
        <section id="jobsource-candidate-editing">
            <h2>Candidate Experience – Guided Profile Editing</h2>
            <p> Because this was also an investor pitch, I designed the editing flows to tell a story about data
                quality. Candidates can add or edit sections in focused modals, with clear labels for role, dates,
                company, responsibilities, and outcomes. Rather than a single intimidating form, the profile grows
                through repeatable patterns: one card per experience, one modal per action. </p>
            <p> This structure makes it easy to imagine onboarding flows, automated prompts to fill gaps, and future
                scoring of profile completeness—all important to highlight for investors. </p>
            <!-- IMAGE: /mnt/data/jobsource - edit profile.png alt="Collage of JobSource edit-profile modals for adding work experience and other résumé sections" -->
        </section>
        <section id="jobsource-mobile">
            <h2>Mobile Experience – Job Search On the Go</h2>
            <p> The mobile prototype translated the same profile concepts into a format that works on smaller screens
                and in short sessions. Candidates can swipe through their profile, review experiences, and quickly
                update fields without digging through nested menus. </p>
            <p> The layout preserves the core hierarchy—summary, experience, skills—while using bottom actions and large
                tap targets to support one-handed use. This helped demonstrate how JobSource could be a companion app
                for ongoing career management rather than a one-time sign-up. </p>
            <!-- IMAGE: /mnt/data/jobsource - mobile proto.png alt="Series of narrow mobile screens showing the JobSource profile and edit flows for a candidate" -->
        </section>
        <section id="jobsource-employer-admin">
            <h2>Employer & Admin Tools – Structured Job Data</h2>
            <p> On the employer side, I designed admin tools that make it easy to keep job and department data clean.
                Forms are simplified into a single-column layout with clear groupings for department, role, location,
                and status, plus validation around required fields. </p>
            <p> This view demonstrates how JobSource could scale with larger organizations: structured fields enable
                consistent job postings, better search, and analytics on hiring across departments—key talking points
                for investors evaluating the business model. </p>
            <!-- IMAGE: /mnt/data/jobsource - update dept.png alt="Admin screen for updating a department and role details within the JobSource employer dashboard" -->
        </section>
        <section id="jobsource-wallet-watch">
            <h2>Cross-Channel Extension – Apple Watch & Wallet</h2>
            <p> To show how JobSource could extend beyond the browser, I explored how candidates might use a JobSource
                pass inside Apple Wallet on Apple Watch. The concept turns a candidate profile into a scannable card
                with their photo, title, and location, plus a QR code that can be used for check-ins at job fairs,
                interviews, or on-site security gates. </p>
            <p> This positions JobSource not only as a job board, but as infrastructure that can support real-world
                hiring workflows. </p>
            <!-- IMAGE: /mnt/data/jobsource - wallet interactions in apple watcj.png alt="Apple Watch screens showing the JobSource wallet pass alongside other wallet cards" -->
        </section>
        <section id="jobsource-wallet-iphone">
            <h2>Cross-Channel Extension – Wallet on iPhone</h2>
            <p> On iPhone, the JobSource pass behaves like a digital ID: candidates can surface their card from Wallet,
                present a QR code, and view basic activity—such as recent check-ins or events. Additional flows explore
                how candidates might manage notification settings or view hiring activity tied to their pass. </p>
            <p> These explorations helped frame JobSource as a platform capable of integrating with enterprise systems,
                attendance tracking, and event analytics—important levers in an investor conversation about long-term
                value. </p>
            <!-- IMAGE: /mnt/data/jobsource - wallet interactions on iphone.png alt="Collage of iPhone wallet interactions showing the JobSource pass, QR code, and activity screens" -->
        </section>
        <section id="jobsource-outcomes">
            <h2>Outcomes & Reflection</h2>
            <p> Although JobSource remained a concept-stage product, the work gave the VC firm a concrete artifact to
                use in investor conversations. The prototype demonstrates a cohesive system: structured candidate data,
                maintainable employer tools, and cross-channel extensions into mobile and wallet experiences. </p>
            <p> For my own practice, this project reinforced how important it is to design for multiple stakeholders in
                parallel—candidates, employers, and platform owners—and to show investors how those pieces connect in a
                scalable way. </p>
