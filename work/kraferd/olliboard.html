      <h1>Designing an On-Site Job Application & Safety Assessment Platform</h1> 
      <p class="muted"> 
        This project was created for a venture capital firm's portfolio companies with high-volume 
    frontline roles. The goal was to build an on-site job application system designed for walk-in 
    candidates. The platform streamlined the application process and embedded a mandatory 
    safety-oriented quiz to help identify candidates with strong situational awareness and 
    responsibility.

<section id="problem">
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Many applicants applied in person without resumes or prior preparation. Paper applications 
    were inconsistent, slow to process, and failed to test whether a candidate demonstrated the 
    safety awareness required for warehouse, manufacturing, or transportation roles. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal was to create a digital flow that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Guided candidates through a clean, simple application</li>
    <li>Ensured all required information was collected</li>
    <li>Evaluated basic safety judgment using scenario-based questions</li>
    <li>Provided an instant “pass/fail” status to hiring staff</li>
  </ul>

<section id="system-overview">
  <h2>System Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The tool was designed as a single unified, multi-step flow:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Welcome & orientation</li>
    <li>Basic personal information collection</li>
    <li>Job role selection and availability</li>
    <li>Experience questionnaires</li>
    <li>Safety quiz with scenario-based questions</li>
    <li>Review & submission</li>
    <li>Pass/fail feedback screen</li>
  </ol>

  <img src="/mnt/data/ollliboard.png" alt="Overview collage of all steps of the application process" />
</section>

<section id="ollliboard-personas">
  <h2>User Personas</h2>
  <p>
    Before defining the application flow, I created a set of representative personas 
    based on real candidate profiles observed at the VC firm's portfolio companies. 
    These personas helped clarify reading levels, technology comfort, preferred channels, 
    and the specific pain points candidates experienced during on-site job applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Olliboard needed to serve applicants with a wide range of backgrounds—some highly 
    tech-comfortable, and others with limited literacy or limited English proficiency. 
    By grounding the intake flow in these personas, I ensured that each step of the 
    application process (personal info, availability, work history, skills, and the 
    safety-oriented quiz) could be completed with minimal friction.
  </p>

  <div class="image-block">
    <!-- IMAGE: /mnt/data/persona - olliboard.png 
         alt="Collage of Olliboard personas: John Evans, Bill Alvarez, Javier Macias, Ethan Grey, including bios, goals, frustrations, jobs-to-be-done, and preferred channels." -->
  </div>

  <p>
    Each persona highlighted different needs:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>John Evans</strong> — needed a fast, straightforward application with bilingual support and minimal typing.</li>
    <li><strong>Bill Alvarez</strong> — needed clear, simple language and preferred in-person or video guidance.</li>
    <li><strong>Javier Macias</strong> — needed better navigability and confidence completing digital forms.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethan Grey</strong> — represented the administrative side, needing reliable, complete applications for processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These personas informed the tone, reading level, button placement, error states, and 
    structure of the safety quiz, ensuring Olliboard could guide candidates through the 
    process regardless of their experience with technology.
  </p>
</section>


<section id="welcome-screen">
  <h2>Welcome & Start Screen</h2>
  <p>
    The entry point introduced the company and set the tone for an encouraging, low-friction 
    experience. Candidates could begin the application immediately on a tablet or kiosk device.
  </p>

  <img src="/mnt/data/ollliboard.png" alt="Welcome screen with photography and Start button" />
</section>

<section id="personal-info">
  <h2>Step 1: Personal Information</h2>
  <p>
    A minimal set of fields kept the barrier to entry low while ensuring employers had essential 
    contact details. The UI focused on large touch targets and clear instructions.
  </p>

  <img src="/mnt/data/ollliboard.png" alt="Personal information form fields" />
</section>

<section id="availability">
  <h2>Step 2: Availability</h2>
  <p>
    Candidates selected the days and times they were available to work. The layout allowed quick 
    scanning of weekly patterns and simplified part-time or rotating shift arrangements.
  </p>

  <img src="/mnt/data/ollliboard.png" alt="Availability selection screen with day and shift options" />
</section>

<section id="experience">
  <h2>Step 3: Work Experience & Background</h2>
  <p>
    The experience section captured relevant background information, previous job roles, and 
    employment history. Questions were designed to be short and structured to minimize time spent 
    typing on a touch device.
  </p>

  <img src="/mnt/data/ollliboard.png" alt="Experience and background form screen" />
</section>

<section id="safety-quiz">
  <h2>Step 4: Safety Quiz</h2>
  <p>
    This was the core differentiator of the system. Candidates completed a scenario-based safety 
    quiz that tested practical judgment and awareness. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The visual design treated the quiz like an assessment, with clear multiple-choice options and 
    a simple step-by-step structure to reduce cognitive load.
  </p>

</section>

<section id="photo-upload">
  <h2>Optional: Document or Photo Upload</h2>
  <p>
    Candidates could optionally upload a photo of certifications or documentation. This was added 
    for companies requiring forklift certification, ID verification, or training proof.
  </p>

  <img src="/mnt/data/ollliboard.png" alt="Document/photo upload grid screen" />
</section>

<section id="review-submit">
  <h2>Step 5: Review & Submit</h2>
  <p>
    The review page displayed all entered information in a structured, printable layout. 
    Candidates could make corrections before final submission.
  </p>

  <img src="/mnt/data/ollliboard.png" alt="Review-and-submit final summary screen" />
</section>

<section id="final-outcome">
  <h2>Outcome Screen</h2>
  <p>
    After submitting, candidates immediately received one of two outcomes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You’re hired / proceed to interview</li>
    <li>Thank you / not a fit at this time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This allowed hiring managers to see the result quickly and continue the process without delay.
  </p>

<section id="impact">
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The final product created a standardized, repeatable on-site application system that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced paperwork and manual data entry</li>
    <li>Filtered candidates based on safety awareness</li>
    <li>Shortened time-to-hire for frontline roles</li>
    <li>Improved candidate clarity and confidence</li>
    <li>Gave hiring managers immediate, structured insights</li>
  </ul>
