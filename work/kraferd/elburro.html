      <h1>El Burro: Restaurant Operations & Ordering Platform</h1>
      <p class="muted">
        El Burro needed one
        clean, custom system to manage multiple locations, help employees move faster, and give customers
        an easy way to order online. I designed the entire platform: from the admin dashboard to the POS
        tools to the full delivery and pickup experience.

      <h2>Project Brief</h2>
      <p>
        When this project kicked off, things were pretty messy. El Burro was growing fast, juggling
        multiple locations, and relying on a patchwork of manual processes. Everyone agreed they needed
        a centralized system, but no one really knew what it should be yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first job was to untangle all the confusion and turn scattered ideas into something
        simple and workable. Once the foundation was clear, the rest of the design process started
        flowing much more smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal: build a fully custom internal platform (instead of using Square, Clover as point-of-service
        or Squarespace as a CMS) that would:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modernize manual workflows</li>
        <li>Reduce employee workload and mistakes</li>
        <li>Support delivery & pickup ordering</li>
        <li>Unify menu management across locations</li>
        <li>Keep the brand experience consistent end-to-end</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="team-role" class="cs-section">
      <h2>The Team & My Role</h2>
      <p>
        I worked as the Lead Product Designer, handling everything from UX flows and IA to
        UI and component design. I partnered closely with the founder and product manager to turn big,
        fuzzy goals into something clean and actionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there was no existing system to build from, I designed the entire product ecosystem from
        scratch: the admin dashboard, POS tools, and both desktop and mobile ordering experiences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="customers-needs" class="cs-section">
      <h2>Customers & Their Needs</h2>

      <h3>1. Restaurant Admins</h3>
      <p>
        Admins needed one place to manage menus, pricing, employees, and orders across multiple locations.
        Bringing everything under one roof gave them the clarity they were missing.
      </p>

        <img src="/work/kraferd/assets/eb-adminflow-yourrestaurants.png" alt="Admin restaurant list" />
      </div>

      <h3>2. Restaurant Employees</h3>
      <p>
        Employees needed a POS flow that was fast, clear, and left little room for errors, especially during busy hours.
      </p>
      <img src="/work/kraferd/assets/eb-anemployee-eventflow.png" alt="Employee POS flow" />

      <h3>3. Customers Ordering Online</h3>
      <p>
        Customers wanted a smooth, no-nonsense ordering experience: browse, customize, check out, and get
        updates on their order. Straightforward and reliable.
      </p>

      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="approach" class="cs-section">
      <h2>Approach</h2>

      <h3>How I Tackled the Problem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Turned unclear requirements into structured flows and priorities</li>
        <li>Mapped journeys for admins, employees, and customers</li>
        <li>Created a scalable information architecture for multiple locations</li>
        <li>Built reusable UI components to keep things consistent</li>
        <li>Designed annotated flows for desktop and mobile</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Design Decisions</h3>

      <h4>1. A Centralized Menu CMS</h4>
      <p>
        One menu system powers all locations, but in case there were any individual updates or product that needed to be moved for that location, I added the ability to update the menu of an individual location.
      </p>
      <img src="/work/kraferd/assets/eb-adminflow-menu.png" alt="Menu CMS" />

      <h4>2. Separate Delivery & Pickup Flows</h4>
      <p>
        Delivery and pickup behave differently in the real world, so I designed dedicated flows for each
        instead of forcing them into the same experience.
      </p>
      <div class="cs-image-group">
        <img src="/work/kraferd/assets/eb-dt-deliveryflow.png" alt="Delivery flow" />
        <img src="/work/kraferd/assets/eb-dt-pickupflow.png" alt="Pickup flow" />
      </div>

      <h4>3. Clear Error States for Employees</h4>
      <p>
        Employees needed error messages that were unmissable and easy to act on, so I redesigned the POS
        error states to be much more direct.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="iteration" class="cs-section">
      <h2>Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        Feedback loops were steady and practical, leading to improvements like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearer multi-location overview for admins</li>
        <li>More helpful error handling for employees</li>
        <li>Backup flows for customers who denied location access</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="constraints" class="cs-section">
      <h2>Constraints</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Building a fully custom system from scratch, no Square/Clover shortcuts</li>
        <li>Complex multi-location menu and employee logic</li>
        <li>Address validation and delivery edge cases to handle</li>
        <li>Pickup needing both location permissions and fallbacks</li>
        <li>
          Store-hour constraints → I designed (and illustrated!!!) a modal letting the user know that the store was
          closed.
          <br />
          <img src="/work/kraferd/assets/eb-edgecase-closedstore.png" alt="Closed store modal" />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="impact" class="cs-section">
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        I unfortunately was not able to access formal metrics, but the improvements were clear:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Employees processed orders faster</li>
        <li>Online orders increased after delivery/pickup launched</li>
        <li>Menus stayed consistent across every location</li>
        <li>Admin overhead dropped significantly</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="reflection" class="cs-section">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        If I revisited this project, I’d:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run earlier usability testing around address/location flows</li>
        <li>Document feedback more formally</li>
        <li>Create an even more robust site map</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
